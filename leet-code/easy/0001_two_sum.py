# Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
# Difficulty: Easy
# Approach: Hash map — store complement as we iterate
# Time: O(n) | Space: O(n)

def two_sum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []


# --- Tests ---

    assert two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) == [0, 1]
    assert two_sum([3, 2, 4], 6) == [1, 2]
